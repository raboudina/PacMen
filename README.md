# PacMen
In this activity I created a pacman on demand (button Click) and moved these pacmen across the page.

- When the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen. 
- When the "Start Game" button is clicked, the pacman or pacmen created start moving at random velocity on the screen. 
- When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes position to stay within the frame of the web page.
